                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">When You Arrive</h3>
                    <p>When you arrive at the gym, you will see a scanner on the wall in front of you, just off to the right side. This is how you sign in and out of your classes.</p>
                    <p>To scan in:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open ClubRight on your phone</li>
                            <li>Check your child's name at the top of the screen, to make sure you're scanning the right code</li>
                            <li>Click the QR code to make it bigger</li>
                            <li>Hold your phone towards the scanner, with your screen facing the scanner until you hear a beep</li>
                            <li>Repeat the process at the end of class to scan out</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>If someone else will be bringing your child to their class, you can send them a screenshot of the code to scan.</p>
                    <p>If you're having trouble with the scanner, don't worry, we will do manual registers too. You can speak to a member of staff or a coach for assistance.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Membership Plans</h3>
        <p>Hamilton Gymnastics Club class fees are covered by a cost effective monthly membership plan which conveniently spreads
            the cost of all regular weekly classes delivered throughout the year (excluding camps and any other pay as you go,
            irregular or one-off activities).</p>
        <p>Provided you maintain your monthly membership payments, no further fees will be due for regular classes and you will
            automatically be re-booked into the next term without the need to re-enter your payment details. We will send out
            term dates in advance of each new term. You can check your bookings in the Clubright app or website, by clicking on
            'My Bookings' in your child's profile.</p>
        <p>Membership payments are taken via direct debit on the 1st of every month. Please note that in order to pass on these
            savings, your subscriptions are payable during school holiday months where no lessons are taking place. Should you
            wish to cancel your membership, we require a minimum of 4 weeks notice in writing (via email) to break the contract
            with Hamilton Gymnastics Club. Please see the cancellation policy below for more details.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Scottish/British Gymnastics Membership</h3>
        <p>Children must register for Scottish/British Gymnastics (SG/BG) membership to participate in our classes for insurance
            purposes. New members may attend a maximum of 2 classes before they must register for this membership. To register
            visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.british-gymnastics.org/membership-join-and-renew"
                target="_blank">https://www.british-gymnastics.org/membership-join-and-renew</a>&nbsp;and click on join (for new
            registrations) or renew (to renew an existing registration). If you experience any problems registering or renewing,
            please phone the BG customer service helpline (0345 1297129).</p>
        <p>All recreational participants will require "Recreational Gymnast" membership. All preschool members will require
            "Pre-school Gymnast" membership. We can’t set up BG membership on any gymnast’s behalf - this process must be
            completed directly through the BG website. BG will advise you of the current membership fee.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>Hamilton Gymnastics Club operates a 4-week cancellation policy - this means that <b>you must give at least 4 weeks
                notice to cancel</b> your membership plan. All cancellation requests must be made in writing to <a
                href="mailto:hgcenquiry@gmail.com">hgcenquiry@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Your membership plan will be pro-rated to reflect any classes which fall within your cancellation period. Once your
            final payment has been received, your membership plan will be cancelled as per your request. If you have multiple
            classes or children booked and only want to cancel part of your bookings, your payments will be amended to reflect
            any activities you would like to continue with.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hgcenquiry@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
