            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Membership Plans</h3>
        <p>Hamilton Gymnastics Club class fees are covered by a cost effective monthly membership plan which conveniently spreads
            the cost of all regular weekly classes delivered throughout the year (excluding camps and any other pay as you go,
            irregular or one-off activities).</p>
        <p>Due to the structure of membership payments being spread over 12 months, new members or new bookings may be subject
            to a
            covering payment adjustment, if your monthly direct
            debit payments to the end of the year do not fully cover the cost of classes booked. This situation arises when
            joining the club or commencing a new class part-way through the year. The covering payment is calculated based on
            the number
            of classes due to be delivered until the end of the year, less the monthly membership payments payable from the
            first direct debit instalment
            date until the end of the year. The covering payment will be the balance of these two figures.</p>
        <p>Provided you maintain your monthly membership payments, no further fees will be due for regular classes and you will
            automatically be re-booked into the next term without the need to re-enter your payment details. We will send out
            term dates in advance of each new term. You can check your bookings in the Clubright app or website, by clicking on
            'My Bookings' in your child's profile.</p>
        <p>Membership payments are taken via direct debit on the 1st of every month. Please note that in order to pass on these
            savings, your subscriptions are payable during school holiday months where no lessons are taking place. Should you
            wish to cancel your membership, we require a minimum of 4 weeks notice in writing (via email) to break the contract
            with Hamilton Gymnastics Club. Please see the cancellation policy below for more details.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Scottish/British Gymnastics Membership</h3>
        <p>Children must register for Scottish/British Gymnastics (SG/BG) membership to participate in our classes
            for insurance
            purposes. New members may attend a maximum of 2 classes before they must register for this membership.
            To register
            visit&nbsp;<a href="https://mybg.british-gymnastics.org"
                target="_blank">https://mybg.british-gymnastics.org</a>&nbsp;and click on
            sign up (for new
            registrations) or login (to renew an existing registration). If you haven't logged into the new My BG portal, you will need to click 'forgot password' to access your child's account. If you experience any problems registering
            or renewing,
            please contact BG member services at <a href="mailto:memberservices@british-gymnastics.org" target="_blank">memberservices@british-gymnastics.org</a>.</p>
        <p>All recreational & preschool participants will require "Community" membership, also known as "Bronze" membership. Preschool participants will receive a discounted rate. We can’t set up BG membership on any gymnast’s behalf - this process
            must be
            completed directly through the BG website. BG will advise you of the current membership fee.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>Hamilton Gymnastics Club operates a 4-week cancellation policy - this means that <b>you must give at least 4 weeks
                notice to cancel</b> your membership plan. All cancellation requests must be made in writing to <a
                href="mailto:hgcenquiry@gmail.com">hgcenquiry@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Your membership plan will be pro-rated to reflect any classes which fall within your cancellation period. Once your
            final payment has been received, your membership plan will be cancelled as per your request. If you have multiple
            classes or children booked and only want to cancel part of your bookings, your payments will be amended to reflect
            any activities you would like to continue with.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hgcenquiry@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
