            <p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
            <p>Our records show that [FirstName]'s Scottish/British Gymnastics membership has now expired, or they don't have membership, which means they are currently not insured to train or compete. To ensure your child can continue attending sessions and remain fully covered, we kindly ask that you renew their membership as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>You can renew or upgrade membership by logging into your Scottish/British Gymnastics account here:</p>
            <p><a href="https://mybg.british-gymnastics.org/Account.mvc/Login" target="_blank">ðŸ‘‰ https://mybg.british-gymnastics.org/Account.mvc/Login</a></p>
            <p>Please note that membership is a requirement for all gymnasts, and without it, [FirstName] will not be able to take part in training or competitions until cover is in place.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need help with the renewal process, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch â€” weâ€™ll be happy to assist.</p>
